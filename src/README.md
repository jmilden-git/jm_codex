# Source Layout

This folder contains the runtime shell, agent implementations, and shareable utilities.

- `agents/` — individual agent packages grouped by responsibility.
- `runtime/` — entry points, schedulers, and process bindings.
- `shared/` — cross-cutting helpers and domain modules.

Add a short README to any new subdirectory describing its purpose and owners.
