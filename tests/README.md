# Testing Layout

- `unit/` — fast-running specs colocated with agents and shared utilities.
- `integration/` — flows that exercise multiple modules or external services.
- `fixtures/` — sanitized payloads and mock responses shared across suites.

Follow the conventions in `AGENTS.md` and keep new test helpers self-documenting.
